# [erinlorelle-simple](https://github.com/erinlorelle/erinlorelle-simple) - html
This "simple" version of the php/laravel site was created afterwards as an alternative way to view the site.  PHP and Laravel are not currently required for this site, but the options are open for expansion as this site continues to evolve.

## Getting Started
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/erinlorelle/erinlorelle-simple`
* Locate the index.html file in the main folder
* Open in a text editor such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or an IDE if connecting to the respository
* Run the index.html file on the local host by selecting Run in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and then selecting your preferred browser.  Google or Firefox are preferred.


### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
